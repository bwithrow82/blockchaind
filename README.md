Homework 1 
Blockchain was created under network known as "blocktest". The network created two nodes which communicate to each other under Node 1 AND Node 2. Each node has a key assigned to it which is identified as node 1  = 0xd1D03575659BC96289D56ab47122efafd508F110 and node 2 =  0xA2376De944dFfd1d0A37326d77CBCd95E645Af4e. The nodes are linked to myCrypto for trading purposes...see screenshots for identification.
